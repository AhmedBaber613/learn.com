                <h2 class="h2">Coding with Style</h2>

                Let’s say you have a bit of code like the following:
                <br><br>
                <xmp><span>beautiful <strong>constellations</strong></span></xmp>
                <br><br>
                If that’s all you have (no CSS), it will look something like this: beautiful constellations. By 
                default, the strong tag simply bolds the text. But 
                let’s say we want to make it fancier. Using CSS, we can change the way the strong tag affects the 
                text. We can make all strong text purple, or underlined, or bigger, for example.
                <br><br>
                Your CSS code has to go in between style tags. The style tag 
                should have an attribute type with the value “text/css”, to tell it that we’re using CSS. 
                Inside of these style tags, we can style things by putting the 
                name of what we want to style in front of curly braces, and putting our styles inside of the curly braces.
                <br><br>
                That probably sounded a little confusing, but it should make more sense with an example:
                <xmp><span><style type="text/css">
                    strong {
                      color: #eeeeee;
                    }
                </style>
                </span></xmp>
                <br>
                Notice how we have strong right in front of the curly braces. 
                This tells us that we’re changing the way the strong tag affects 
                the text. Inside of the curly braces, we can list our CSS properties in the format:
                <xmp>property: value;</xmp>
                <br>
                In this case, the property is color and the value is #eeeeee.
                <br><br>
                Quick note: The value #eeeeee represents a color in a special way that computers can understand. 
                The format is a hashtag symbol (#) followed by six numbers or letters. The technical term for 
                it is a hexadecimal color code. You can use the color picker below to find out the color code for any color, to use it in your CSS.
                <br><br>
                Color code:  
                #eeeeee
                If you are curious about how these codes work, I wrote a brief explanation in the 
                appendix of this tutorial. But you don't need to understand them to use them; you just need to know 
                how to find the code for the color you want, by using a hexadecimal color picker like the one above.

            <h2 class="h21">HTML</h2>
            <p>
                In this example, we are setting the color to a color code, #eee, or 
                light gray. Now, if we use the same HTML, we get a different result: beautiful constellations
                <br><br>
                Well, we can’t see that very well. Luckily, there’s another property we can change that might make that text easier to see. The 
                background-color attribute will change the background color of whatever you 
                are styling. Let’s add a line for background-color, changing it to #000000, or black:
                <xmp><span><style type="text/css">
                    strong {
                        color: #eeeeee;
                        background-color: #000000;
                    }
                    </style>
                </span></xmp>
                <br>
                Now, our HTML will render like this: beautiful constellations
            </p>
        </div>

                <h2 class="h2">HTML Tags: An Introduction</h2>

                If you’ve ever seen HTML before, you know there are a lot of things that go in between < and > signs. These things are called tags. 
                There are two types of tags in HTML, but we’re going to just worry about one to begin with. The first type of tag is the opening and closing tag. 
                Here is an example:
                <br><br>
                <span><xmp><em>supernova</em> explosion</xmp></span>
                <br><br>
                There are a couple of things to note about this example. Let’s not worry about what em means, and just focus on the basic syntax. First, 
                notice how there is a forward 
                slash in the second em tag. That indicates that it is a closing tag. The first em tag is an opening tag. 
                Everything in between the opening and closing tags is affected by the tag.
                <br><br>
                Thus, in this example, the word supernova will be affected by the em tags, but the word explosion will not be 
                affected (it is outside the tags). Pretty simple so far, right?
                <br><br>
                You can place these tags inside of each other. This is called nesting tags in programmer speak. For example:
                <br><br>
                <span><xmp><em>supernova <strong>explosion</strong></em></xmp></span>
                <br><br>
                Here, the word supernova is affected by only the <span class="intro">em</span> tag, but the word explosion is 
                affected by both the <span class="intro">em</span> and <span class="intro">strong</span> tags.
                <br><br>
                The word supernova is affected by only the <span class="intro">em</span> tag, but the word explosion has both and is affected by both tags.
                <br><br>
                Now that we have these out of the way, let’s talk about what these tags actually mean and do - and learn some more while we’re at it.

                <h2 class="h2">Border, Margin, and Padding</h2>

                Let’s introduce a few more attributes you can use to style the header, content, and footer from the last section. 
                Using CSS, we can give each section a fancy border, a margin, and some padding.
                <br><br>
                While you’re working through this section, be sure to follow along using the HTML 
                code from the last section to see all of the code in action!
                <br><br>
                The border CSS attribute looks like this:
                <br>
                <xmp>
                    #header {
                        border: 2px solid #00ff00; // green
                    }
                </xmp>
                <br>
                (Remember, // green is a comment which means everything after the // will be ignored.)
                <br><br>
                The value of the border attribute has three parts:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>2px - This is how wide the border is, in pixels.</li> <br>
                    <li>solid - This is the style of the border. Solid means it will be a solid line. You can also have dashed, for a dashed line, dotted for a dotted line, or inset for a cool 3D effect.</li> <br>
                    <li>#0f0# - This is the color of the border, as a hexadecimal color code.</li> <br>
                </ul>
                Try adding different borders to your header, content, and footer. You can try writing different values for each of the three parts: 
                for example, try writing 10px instead of 2px for the width, try 
                writing dashed instead of solid, and try picking a different hexadecimal color!
                <br><br>
                Next, let’s talk about the margin and padding of an element. First, the margin refers to the space around your element. Try adding 
                the following 20-pixel margin to your header and see what happens. 
                We’ll also add a border so you can clearly see the borders of the element.
                <br>
                <xmp>
                    #header {
                        border: 2px solid #00ff00; 
                        margin: 20px;
                    }
                </xmp>
                <br>
                If you try this out on your page, you’ll see the element appear to shrink as it gets 20 pixels of 
                margin around each side. Now, let’s see what padding does:
                <br><br>
                <xmp>
                    #header {
                        border: 2px solid #00ff00; 
                        padding: 20px;
                    }
                </xmp>
                <br>
                Try it out! Now, you’ll see that the space between the borders and the stuff inside 
                of the header has increased. Padding refers to the 
                space inside an element that’s padding out its contents. Here, you can see that there are 
                20 pixels of space between the border and the text inside.
                <br><br>
                Note that some HTML elements have a bit of border and margin by 
                default, so they might not behave exactly as you expect. 
                For example, the h1 tag has some top and bottom margin by default, 
                so you can expect to see a little extra vertical space 
                in this padding example.
                <br><br>
                Finally, what if you only want there to be a border on the bottom of the 
                element? Or what if you want to only put margin 
                on the top of an element, or only pad one side? For the border, 
                margin, and padding attributes, you can specify a single side by writing 
                -top, -bottom, -left, or -right after the attribute. For example:
                <br>
                <xmp>
                    #header {
                        border-top: 2px solid #00ff00; 
                        margin-bottom: 20px; 
                        padding-left: 20px;
                    }
                </xmp>
                <br>
                In this example, there will only be a border at the top, a margin 
                on the bottom, and a padding on the left side of the element.
            </p>
        </div>

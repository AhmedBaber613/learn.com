                Congratulations on making it this far into the tutorial! You’re right at the end now, and you’re ready to put what you’ve learned together. You’ve already learned: <br>
                <br><br>
                How to write basic HTML and CSS <br>
                How to make multiple HTML files on your computer, open them in the web browser, and link them together <br>
                How to add images to your page <br>
                How to set things like fonts, borders, and colors on your page and things in your page <br>
                How to arrange your webpage into a header, sidebar, content and footer <br>
                With this, you can really begin to make your very own basic website! I encourage you now to try and make a basic website on your computer. Even if no one ever sees it, it will be a great start to your web development journey. Practice is the best, and only way, to get good! <br>
                <br>
                For example, try making an About Me website with multiple pages about you, your hobbies, and interests. You could also make a website about anything you like, such as an animal or TV show or band. <br>
                <br>
                While you’re making your site, don’t be afraid to go out and learn more than what this simple tutorial has taught you. For example, maybe you want to set a tiling image as your page background. You can easily search up how to write the CSS for a background image. Remember that CSS attributes will always look like ATTRIBUTE: VALUE; and you will be all set. <br>
                <br>
                If you do want to put your website online, here are two FREE places you can do it: <br>
                <br>
                Neocities - Like the famous Geocities of old, Neocities is a place where you can build your own free website one page at a time. It features a way for you to edit the HTML of your webpages directly in the browser. <br>
                Netlify - My favorite choice, hosting your website on Netlify is as easy as dragging and dropping the folder containing your website into Netlify. <br>
                All right, that’s all for now. I hope you found this tutorial helpful - now go out there and have fun building your new site! <br>

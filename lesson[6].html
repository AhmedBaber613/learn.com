                Now that you know a bit of basic HTML, let’s talk about the structure of an HTML page. 
                While you can write any HTML into a file 
                and run it, web pages have a particular HTML structure that can be followed. Following this 
                structure will ensure your web page runs correctly even as it gets more complicated.
                <br><br>
                First, all HTML documents have to start with a special line that declares 
                that the document type is HTML. This line 
                looks a bit like a tag, but it’s actually not an HTML tag, it’s a “declaration”. It 
                tells the web browser what type of document it is, in this case, HTML.
                <br>
                Whenever you make an HTML file, be sure to write this as the very first line.
                <br><br>
                Next, the entire document is enclosed within html tags, which acts as a 
                container for everything else. Within this, our HTML page is split into two parts, 
                which are also opening and closing tags: a head and a body.
                <br><br>
                Inside the head, we place information about 
                the page which isn’t directly visible on the page. One such tag is the 
                title tag, which controls the text displayed in the top of the browser tab.
                <br><br>
                Inside the body is where our actual visible HTML elements go. This is where we can write 
                paragraphs of text, titles with the h1 tag, and more.
                <br><br>
                So for example, a simple page could look like this:
                <br><br>
                You can try copying this into a new file with a .html extension, and opening it in your 
                browser to see what it says. You’ll notice that it says “My Website” in the browser tab, 
                which is the result of the title tag.
                <br>
                Then, on the actual page, you’ll see what’s in the body.
                <br><br>
                Congratulations on sticking with me this far! You now know enough basic HTML to move on to the next section: basic CSS.

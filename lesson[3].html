                <h2 class="h2">A Smattering of Tags</h2>

                Tags get more fun once you have a couple to play with. Here are some basic tags that you should know about as a novice HTML coder. 
                Remember that these are all opening and closing tags - they affect the text that they enclose. Weâ€™ll talk about the second type of tag soon.
                <br><br>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="intro">em</span> - This stands for emphasis and is used when you want to emphasize text. By default, this will render as italic.</li><br>
                <li><span class="intro">strong</span> - This is used for text that is strongly important. By default, this renders as bold.</li><br>
                <li><span class="intro">h1</span> - This stands for header 1 and is the largest type of header, or page title. There are also tags h2 through h6. They get progressively smaller, and are used for subheaders or subtitles. By default, this will render as bold, large text on its own line.</li><br>
                <li><span class="intro">p</span> - This stands for paragraph and should be used to enclose paragraphs of text. By default, this will have the effect of pressing enter on your keyboard twice before the paragraph.</li><br>
                <li><span class="intro">ol</span> and <span class="intro">ul</span> - These are ordered list and unordered lists, in other words: numbered lists and bulleted lists. Inside the list, each item should be within an li (list item) tag.</li><br>
                <li><span class="intro">div</span> - This stands for division, in other words, a section of the page. This is a versatile tag used to organize more complex HTML into sections. We will use this one more in the CSS section.</li><br>
            </ul>

            <p>
                For example, check out the following code. Can you guess what it will look like?
            </p>

            <p>
                <xmp><span><h1>Page Title</h1>
            </p>

            <p>Lorem ipsum <strong>dolor</strong> sit <em>amet</em></p>
                    
            <ol>
              <li>Item number one</li>
              <li>Item number two</li>
              <li>Item number three</li>
            </ol></span></xmp>

            <p>You can run this code yourself to find out:</p><br>

            <ol>
                <li>Create a file named <span class="intro">mywebpage.html</span>. You can actually name it anything you want, but make sure it ends in .html!</li>
                <li>Copy the above example into the file, and save the file.</li>
                <li>Open the file in a web browser to see your HTML in action!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Once you have this file, you can make changes to it and then refresh the page in your browser to see your changes. Try it:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><xmp><h2>Page Subtitle</h2> on a new line after the h1 code.</xmp></li>
                <li>Save the file.</li>
                <li>Refresh the page in your web browser to see what your new line of code does!</li>
            </ol>

            <p>A quick note on editing HTML files: The best way to edit HTML files is with a text editor such as Notepad++ (if on Windows) or Sublime Text. 
               You have to use a text editor instead of something like Microsoft 
               Word, because an HTML file is just text, without special formatting. You can use a simple program like Notepad, but I recommend something with more 
               features such as the ability to display different parts of your code in different colors to help you read it (called syntax highlighting).
